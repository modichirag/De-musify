## Understand_your_music
The project aims to allow users to get their playlists from spotify, get features for the songs in those playlists and make a scatter plot for those features. <br>
The module get_spotify_music/spotifyuser.py has the main class. For every user, once the class instantiation is created and authorization is done, user can use functions like get_playlist_details and get_features_playlist to get the required features for their playlists. <br>
The module get_spotify_music/plotting.py provides two functions to create a scatter plot between multiple features of a given playlist or of any two features for multiple playlists. <br>

### Todo:
